            Nearly 1 in 4 women in their menstruating years experience “period poverty,” ranging from the inability to purchase the products they need to the inability to go to work, school, and get out in life in general because of it.
            Menstrual products are used as bargaining chips to gain power and control over inmates for incarcerated women. Even though federal law states prisoners have a right to free menstrual products to ensure they have clean conditions during their incarceration, those menstrual products are still being withheld from them by people who are willfully violating their human rights. And on the state level, access to menstrual products is even worse, with many states putting a cap on the number of menstrual products inmates can receive each month.
            Many incarcerated women bargain for menstrual products every month, and when that doesn’t work, they are forced to bleed straight through their clothes and sit in their own menstrual blood for hours on end. And the people who are supposed to protect and help you mock you and call you disgusting for a natural bodily function almost everyone with a uterus has. That’s the reality many incarcerated menstruators face across the globe.

            Lack of access to sanitary products for homeless women is a devastating and overlooked healthcare injustice that needs to be rectified.
            Homeless women confront the daunting challenge of securing materials to absorb blood and finding privacy to change and dispose of used sanitary products. Soiled
            clothing may be cleaned without soap, using dirty water. Indoor drying without sunlight is common.
            The Urban Institute estimates that 3.5 million people, including 1.35 million children, are homeless during a given year.
            Menstrual bleeding and management are taboo as a public discussion subject.
            Although commonly reported in underdeveloped nations, scholar search for menstrual hygiene management in United States homeless women revealed sparse mention of this pervasive health concern.
