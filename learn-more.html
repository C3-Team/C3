            Nearly 1 in 4 women in their menstruating years experience “period poverty,” ranging from the inability to purchase the products they need to the inability to go to work, school, and get out in life in general because of it.

            Menstrual products are used as bargaining chips to gain power and control over inmates for incarcerated women. Many incarcerated women bargain for menstrual products every month, and when that doesn’t work, they are forced to bleed straight through their clothes and sit in their own menstrual blood for hours on end.

            Homeless women confront the daunting challenge of securing materials to absorb blood and finding privacy to change and dispose of used sanitary products. The Urban Institute estimates that 3.5 million people, including 1.35 million children, are homeless during a given year.

            1 in 5 teens have struggled to afford period products or have not been able to purchase them at all, and one-in-four teens have missed class due to the lack of access to menstrual hygiene products.
